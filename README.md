I used SageMath. It compiles but very unforgiving, it doesn't show where your syntax is wrong!
Symbol relations is ambiguous - how does the parser differentiate pipe from absolute value, or norm?
SageMath has hiccups writing some nested fractions.
Evaluation of brackets for long equations in Jupyterlab/notebook markdown will make your code not compile! Frustrating, but it works when the above items are taken into keen consideration.
