Curvature is flattening out coordinates(transforming a metric to a  2D rectilinear flat space, replaced by proper time, otherwise curved).  Tidal forces are an obstruction of gravitational fields(coordinate transformation) in an inertial(accelerated) reference frame. Truly gravity bends light!..by a factor. The proofs... star-light observation during a solar eclipse, geodesics(tangent vectors), parallel transport(a gyroscope doesn't end in the same vector), abstract Mathematics,...
I encountered hiccups writing some nested fractions, and certain functions.
How the Linux kernel bypasses the windows tpm module on BIOS boot menu, only the coding can explain{The machine memory area usage map of the Linux kernel does not use BIOS functions, nor does it use the
interrupt vector table set by the BIOS} https://download.oldlinux.org/ECLK-5.0-WithCover.pdf
